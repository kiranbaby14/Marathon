                        <p>To achieve their success, they had a team of supporters, patrons and professionals on the journey to their respective podiums. In most cases these people sit in the shadows of history, but will always be remembered and appreciated.
                            We want the University Ultra Run 2023 to be a peopleâ€™s event and for everyone to shine in the success of achieving the perceived impossible.

                            With this in mind we have established our 1050 mile Patron fundraiser
